# Hello World!

This is [Monzer Omer](https://github.com/monzersmiledev), And this is the place where I build some stuff (may be useful stuff unlike WebFluent), I've been working with startup companies for the past 4 to 5 years, And I'm not going to lie, It's a painful *AF*.

 - No Code Documentation. 
 - No System Design Most of the time. 
 - No Testing (All Manual).
 
And they keep cycling on the same thing for months. 

My plan for this Organization account is:

 1. Build Open Source.
 2. Try and learn new stuff.
 3. Create tools for my fellow developers.

Also, I welcome all your suggestions and ideas. 
So, feel free to start a new discussion about your ideas/feedback.

If you have any feature request, open a new issue with a full description for it on the project repo.
And I welcome all your contributions.

See ya.
